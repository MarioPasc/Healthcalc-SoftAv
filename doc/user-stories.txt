   User Stories 
===================

IdealWeight:
"As a HealthCalc User
I want to input my gender and height into the calculator
So that I can calculate my ideal weight"

BasalMetabolicRate:
"As a nutritionist
I want to determine the basal metabolic rate of my client
So that I can elaborate a better diet plan for him/her"

===================
Acceptance Criteria
===================

IdealWeight:

Scenario: Calculate ideal weight with valid parameters
Given I am a HealthCalc user
When I input my gender and height into the calculator
Then the calculator should calculate and display my ideal weight.

Scenario: Display error when input parameters are incorrect
          (e.g. height less or equal to zero, gender not recognized by the system)
Given I am a HealthCalc user
When I input my gender and height into the calculator
     AND the systems recognizes the inputs as invalid
Then the calculator should display a specific error message guiding me to enter a valid gender and height.

Scenario: Display error when input height exceeds the max value admitted by the datatype (int) 
Given I am a HealthCalc user
When I input a height value that is too high for IdealWeight
Then the calculator should throw an overflow error

Scenario: Display error when computed ideal weight is negative or zero 
Given I am a HealthCalc user
When I input my gender and height into the calculator
     AND the computed ideal weight is less or equal to zero 
Then the calculator should display an error message indicating an unrealistic output.


BasalMetabolicRate:

Scenario: Calculate the basal metabolic rate with valid inputs
Given I am a nutritionist
When I input my client's weight, age, height, and gender into the calculator
Then the calculator should compute and display its basal metabolic rate.

Scenario: Display error when input parameters are incorrect
          (e.g., gender not recognized by the system, numeric inputs less or equal to zero)
Given I am a nutritionist
When I input my client's weight, age, height, and gender into the calculator
     AND the inputs are recognized as invalid by the system
Then the calculator should display specific error messages for each type of invalid input.

Scenario: Display error when numeric input parameters are too high 
          (INTEGER.MAX_VALUE for age and heigh and FLOAT.MAX_VALUE for weight) 
Given I am a nutritionist
When I input values for my client's weight, age, or height 
     AND any value is too high for its datatype 
Then the calculator should display an overflow error.

Scenario: Display error when computed basal metabolic rate is negative or zero 
Given I am a nutritionist
When I input my client's weight, age, height, and gender into the calculator
     AND the computed basal metabolic rate is less or equal to zero 
Then the calculator should display an error message indicating unrealistic output value.
